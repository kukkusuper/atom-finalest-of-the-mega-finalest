<h3><br>
    Atoms are the fundamental building blocks of all matter, forming the basis of everything in the universe.<br>
    Understanding atoms is crucial because they are the smallest units of chemical elements that retain the <br> 
    properties of those elements. Composed of protons, neutrons, and electrons, atoms combine in various <br> 
    ways to form molecules, which make up the substances and materials we encounter every day.<br>
    The study of atoms is essential for a wide range of scientific fields, including chemistry, physics, <br>
    biology, and material science. Atoms determine the structure, behavior, and interactions <br>
    of all substances,allowing scientists to explain why materials have certain properties, how chemical <br>
    reactions occur, and how life itself is sustained.
